        <p style="text-indent: 2em;">Hello there! I see you've clicked on the "Read More" button, so... Here you go! My name is Steven, as you know, and MechaPuma is basically a little project I used to work on in my free time.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em">Over the few years this channel has been up, I have gotten more and more motivation to put a great amount of effort into my videos. Thanks to you and the rest of the community, the channel has amounted to over 200,000 overall views, which means so, so much to me! My goal is to try and spread humor across the depths of the internet and throughout the atmospheric layers of the Earth—and who knows, maybe the cosmos someday? :D</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em">Enough about statistics and pixellated numbers—let's talk about me—hopefully not in too selfish of a manner, haha! I've spent the entirety of my life trying to find out what I want to do with the life I've been given. I'm a California-born eighteen-year-old "YouTuber" (if that's what you want to call me) who has a very strange sense of humor that not many people seem to understand. I was always told that my brain was "wired differently" than other people's brains, due to my ass burgers—just kidding; that's not how it's spelled! I also have minor OCD and ADHD, but throughout my life, I have managed to better myself—or at least I hope so!</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em">I believe my odd sense of humor mainly came from my parents, and the occasional joke(s) I hear from the community around me. They really inspired me to attempt my own online 'comedy show', or whatever it's called now. I've really never been a fan of crowds—rather, I've been a fan of communities and communication, possibly some advice-seeking.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em">While I do miss the good ol' days when I was young and innocent, I do want to educated myself and others about events they may not know about. There's no promise I'll do that online, but I sure hope I'll muster up the courage to do that sometime shortly. I've always wanted to start some type of 'muck-raker' series on my channel to expose companies and people for being genuinely evil. I ponder over whether or not I should post this on the channel all the time, but... I've never really gotten to it, unfortunately.</p>
        <p style="text-indent: 2em">Speaking of the "good ol' days" when I was just a kid, I received my first camera when I was only eight years old. From my memory, it was a Christmas gift, so it was more like late 2008. Anyway, I was enthralled. It was a cheap handheld camera from QVC or HSN (one of the two now irrelevant shopping networks)—and it only costed about twenty dollars. But I didn't care; little Steven had fun shooting random videos of my family and I—until the camera broke. Over my lifetime, I've always loved art art—especially filmmaking!</p>
