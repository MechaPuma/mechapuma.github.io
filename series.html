                <p style="text-indent: 2em">"Creative" Content is quite the series here on MechaPuma. In this series, I make fun of various fandoms, such as the furry fandom, brony fandom, Sonic fandom, Cuphead fandom, Flat Earth Society, and more! Each episode is a new roast on a community! This series isn't to be taken too seriously though, as I do not actually hate on these communities. Although sometimes harsh, it should be noted that it's for the entertainment of the YouTube community and should be funny, not hurtful! It accounts for a good 75,000 overall channel views thanks to you guys and girls!</p>

            <div class="pagetitle2">DONNIE (DONALD TRUMP)</div>
                <p>For me, this is the most entertaining series to produce—but what are these Donnie songs about? Throughout the years, I've seen countless amounts of music video "parodies" online, yet none of them seem to be all that funny... or punny for that matter. I've seen artists such as Filthy Frank (Papa Franku) and Dave Days create music videos on popular figures—especially relevant politicians. Since I am personally facepalming at the current state of American politics, I decided to express that annoyance and outrage in a music video in order to channel my inner libtard! Hopefully you all enjoy the Trump parodies—because more are coming soon!</p>

            <div class="pagetitle2">PARODIES</div>
                <p>Oh, boy... and girl! Whew, didn't mean to be s3x1st! Anyway, parodies on the MechaPuma channel are fairly common and are highly looked down upon by people who actually want to get something done—and I apologize in advance—but it's well worth the angry comments! Pretty much, it's just me completely failing at doing basic DIYs, tech reviews, and anything interactional. The main premise of this is to make fun of gaming, technology, and DIY channels (at least for a majority of my parody-oriented videos), highlighting thier many flaws and how ridiculous some channels under these categories actually get. It's almost like a 2010 clickbait troll, yet it somehow managed to make its way into 2018. Oh boy... and Siri...</p>

            <div class="pagetitle2">MEME-IFY</div>
                <p>Welcome to the most interactive series on the MechaPuma channel—for now... In this series, anyone from anywhere can participate. Based on the topic I give for the next episode, I allow the community around the channel to make me a meme from what I say. For instance, I asked for a 'Cupsona'—and I got this...</p>
