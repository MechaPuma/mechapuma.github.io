Trump (unfortunately) and mother of at least 0.75 kids — has captured my heart. Using songs (such as "Melania has got it going on"), we shall help her find the REAL man of her dreams! Donald might be President, but I know she needs a better man: one who can avoid avoiding military drafts due to bone spurrs, one who can say "China" with a straight face... one who can sing about her and make her feel somewhat significant to the world.</p>

However, this does leave a rather powerful message behind: neither are going anywhere — and will not be defeated.</p><p>Let's find out who will win this war once-and-for-all when the proper time comes! We must keep a close eye on both sides and their platforms — mainly consisting of basic social media — and TikTok?!</p>

                <div style="margin-top: -1.5em;" class="highlights transition1 positionRelative">Which side am I on?!</div><br><br>
                    <div style="background-color: white; text-indent: 2em; margin-top: -1em;" class="subcategory1 transition1 positionRelative">Who, me?! Personally, I just want to see how this whole thing plays out, and honestly have never had much experience with furries — outside of the internet subculture, that is! I mean, I DID get to see one at Comic Con, and he or she (maybe in=between) was actually pretty adorable!</div>

                    <div style="background-color: white; text-indent: 2em;" class="subcategory1 transition1 positionRelative">So, I guess if I really had to pick a side, I'd go with furries? Animal people sound pretty kewl! Gamers would most likely have the better guns, but at least furries would have the merch on their side! Plus, gamers talk about a ton of obnoxious, toxic stuff a lot of the times — that no human being on Earth really cares about anymore. For example, there's Ben Shapiro, or Gamer Gate... ugh. If I'm getting owned with facts and logic™, please make it worth the wait! It's pretty bland and boring usually!</div>
